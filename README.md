# Edinburgh Hoppers Website

## intro
The website runs on **Jekyll**. This means it's relatively easy to work with collaboratively, and it's possible to make the pages look and feel consistent across the whole of the website with the use of **templates**.

## installation
Jekyll runs a server on your local machine that will allow the website to be viewed on your web browser by navigating to, by default, the following address:
localhost:4000 (aka 127.0.0.1:4000)
